# Hosted Login Page Configurator
Enables Auth0 customers to customize their Hosted Login Page with just a few clicks.

Live demo: [HLP Configurator](https://auth0-hlpc.firebaseapp.com) (works with fixed credentials of a test account)

## Use case
  1) Open the [demo](https://auth0-hlpc.firebaseapp.com)
  1) Read the explanation of the purpose of the site that has just opened
  1) Click continue

  1) Click Edit.
  1) In the sidebar that has just appeared see the **Properties** and **Html** tabs, and a select box showing options: **Global settings**(selected) and **Log In Screen**
  1) Click the color button in the **Primary color** setting
  1) See the color picker
  1) Pick red color in the color picker
  1) See the autosave feedback label with text **Saving...** first and then **Saved!** under the **Primary color** setting and see the color change in the login page
  1) Click **Html** tab
  1) In the code editor that has just appeared, add your site's header code and click save button located above the editor
  1) See the header in the login page preview
  1) Click **Open live version**

  **Note:** As being considered a bad practice, no work was made on a step asking the customer for his client credentials, although this was part of the initial excercise commitment:
  > 4) Click continue
  > 1) Read the reasons to insert client credentials (client_id/client_secret) in the shown form
  > 1) Fill client_id
  > 1) Fill client_secret
